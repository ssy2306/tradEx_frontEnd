## Project Overview
TradEx Insights is a dynamic web-based trading information platform designed to provide cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders with a comprehensive and interactive experience. This platform combines real-time market data, community engagement features, and predictive machine learning algorithms to empower users in the cryptocurrency trading sphere.

Backend: 
The project "Tradez" leverages a robust backend stack, which comprises the following key technologies and components:

Node.js: The project's backend is powered by Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, known for its speed and scalability, enabling efficient request handling and response generation.

Express.js: Express.js is employed as the web application framework, facilitating the development of RESTful APIs and the handling of HTTP requests, making it a reliable choice for building a solid foundation.

Prisma ORM: Tradez utilizes Prisma, an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, to interact with the database seamlessly. Prisma abstracts database operations and simplifies data management.

SQL Database: The backend integrates a SQL database to securely store user data and application information. SQL databases are widely recognized for their structured data management and relational data capabilities.
